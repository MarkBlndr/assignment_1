        <p>The Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus), also known as the common rat, street rat, sewer rat, wharf rat, Hanover 
          rat, brown rat, Norwegian rat and Parisian rat, is a widespread species of common rat.

          One of the largest muroids, it is a brown or grey rodent with a head and body length of  
          up to 28 cm (11 in) long, and a tail slightly shorter than that. It weighs 
          between 140 and 500 g (4.9 and 17.6 oz). Thought to have originated in northern 
          China and neighbouring areas, this rodent has now spread to all continents except Antarctica, and is 
          the dominant rat in Europe and much of North America. With rare exceptions, the brown rat lives 
          wherever humans live, particularly in urban areas.
