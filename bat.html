            The big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) is a species of vesper bat distributed widely 
            throughout North America, the Caribbean, and the northern portion of South America. 
            <br><br>
            It was first described as a species in 1796. Compared to other microbats, the big brown bat is relatively large, 
            weighing 15–26 g (0.53–0.92 oz) and possessing a wingspan of 32.5–35 cm (12.8–13.8 in). Big brown bats are 
            insectivorous, consuming a diverse array of insects, particularly night-flying insects, but 
            especially beetles.[4] Some of the beetles it consumes are serious agricultural pests, including 
            cucumber beetles. They are nocturnal, foraging for prey at night and roosting in sheltered areas 
            during the day such as caves, tunnels, tree cavities, and human structures. Their breeding season 
            is in the fall, shortly before their annual hibernation. After hibernation ends in the spring, 
            females form maternity colonies for giving birth to young. Oftentimes only one offspring is 
            produced per litter, though twins are common in the Eastern US. Lifespans of 6.5 years are 
            considered average.
