            The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is the largest of the true foxes and one of the 
            most widely distributed members of the order Carnivora, being present across 
            the entire Northern Hemisphere including most of North America, Europe and Asia, 
            plus parts of North Africa.

            It is listed as least concern by the IUCN. Its range has 
            increased alongside human expansion, having been introduced to Australia, where it is 
            considered harmful to native mammals and bird populations. Due to its presence in 
            Australia, it is included on the list of the "world's 100 worst invasive species". The red fox 
            originated from smaller-sized ancestors from Eurasia during the Middle Villafranchian period,
            and colonised North America shortly after the Wisconsin glaciation. 
            Among the true foxes, the red fox represents a more progressive form in the 
            direction of carnivory. Apart from its large size, the red fox is distinguished 
            from other fox species by its ability to adapt quickly to new environments. 
            Despite its name, the species often produces individuals with other colourings, 
            including leucistic and melanistic individuals.
